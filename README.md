In this repository, you will find my work which is a visual clone of Facebook. I wanted to apply my knowledge of html and css to develop a real world applications. A major goal that I wanted to achieve while building the facebook clone was to create good user experience for whoever was viewing it. To achieve this, I worked to make the page responsive on all screen sizes.

The project consists of the page after you log in while using Facebook. The left part of the page is the side navigation section. It contains information such as your profile, what groups you are a part of, what games you have played, etc. In the middle, we have the main feed. Towards the top of this section is the stories and reels. Below it is section where people create their posts to post on Facebook. The middle section ends with a post about baseball from NBC Sports Boston. Lastly, the right part of the page included a list of the contacts. In this case, I used fake names and stock photos to mimick the actual website.

There were some challenges that I faced during the production of the clone. One challenege was making sure that all of the content looked good on any screen size. The layout for the mobile version is completely different from the larger devices. For example, this is the mobile version: 

<div style="width: 300px ; height: 300px">![facebook-mobile-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61445847/229669760-0ca0f4d7-9d6b-467c-9db9-1668b2a4f44b.jpg)</div>
